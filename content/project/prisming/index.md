PRISMING builds a private blockchain platform to enhance transparency and efficiency of in-kind donations. This project was supported by the Seoul NPO Center. We also collaborated with the Ground X, a Korean blockchain lead, and the SK Happiness Foundation, a Korean nonprofit organization, for developing a real-world case.

In August 2018, team gave two talks:

- New Kids on the Blockchain, WeWork at Euljiro, Seoul, Republic of Korea / August 31, 2018.
- Crypto on the Beach: Blockchain for Good, Naksan Beach Hotel, Yangyang, Gangwon-do, Republic of Korea / August 19, 2018.

During the first half of 2019, we collaborated with the Ground X and the SK Happiness Foundation to develop a proof-of-concept pilot system for in-kind donations. Details can be found in the public report written by the Ground X. Our project has been covered by press.
