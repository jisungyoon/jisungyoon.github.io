abstract: Humans acquire and accumulate knowledge through language usage and eagerly exchange their knowledge for advancement. Although geographical barriers had previously limited communication, the emergence of information technology has opened new avenues for knowledge exchange. However, it is unclear which communication pathway is dominant in the 21st century. Here, we explore the dominant path of knowledge diffusion in the 21st century using Wikipedia, the largest communal dataset. We evaluate the similarity of shared knowledge between population groups, distinguished based on their language usage. When population groups are more engaged with each other, their knowledge structure is more similar, where engagement is indicated by socio-economic connections, such as cultural, linguistic, and historical features. Moreover, geographical proximity is no longer a critical requirement for knowledge dissemination. Furthermore, we integrate our data into a mechanistic model to better understand the underlying mechanism and suggest that the main channel of information distribution in the 21st century is based online.

summary: In the 21st century, humans acquire and exchange knowledge primarily through language usage, with the emergence of information technology breaking down geographical barriers. A study using Wikipedia, a vast dataset, explores how knowledge diffusion occurs. It finds that when population groups have more socio-economic connections, like cultural and linguistic ties, their shared knowledge is more similar. Geographical proximity is no longer crucial for knowledge dissemination, and the dominant channel for information distribution in the 21st century appears to be online.
